- Install the JDK 9 
- Change the JAVA_HOME environment variable to jdk folder
- We want to use binary exe files so add the foder %JAVA_HOME%/bin , this will allow all the files accesible through cmd from any location


================JSHELL======================
- A REPL for java programming language
- provides a basic interactive tool where a dev can execute expressions (like str.equals("messi")), statmenets code ending with ; is called statment
- We can save code session writeen and then rerun it later on other JDK, or same JDK
- REPL meaning : Read evaluate Print loop, We can define variebles, evaluate expresions,statments without opening IDE
- The main benefits are:
	a. To write some code and have fun and see some results randomly we do not have to open IDE and write some boier plate code like class, main method and all
	b. For new learners this will be easy to focus on programming until they gradually learn IDE and other things related to it
	c. Reduces writing boier plate code , and instead we can foxus on expression ,statments,logic then put that in main project
	d. no need to import, no semicolon, less verbose code, very less bolier plate code -> greate for learning and playing
	e. We can bypass the exception handling code unlike IDE
- To see what all imports are there for code -> /imports
- All commsnds starts with / eg /imports , /help
- /history : shows all the commnsd whetehr it was help command , /command , code snippet anythings
- /list: shows all the code snippets , like method, print satment etc: we can list the snippet and use command /cnippetid to execute the code snipped
- /vars: shows applicable variables from code snippets 
- Cntrl A -> goes the jshel typing cursor to left most , Cntrl -E to go till end of line 
	-> similar to home and end  used in IDE/text editor
- Contrl R to search for any text in history -> just like linux 

- Commands related to setting editor
	- /set editor notepad++.exe : Set editor as notepad++ for the session 
	- /set editor -default: set to default
	- /set editor -retian notepad++.ex : To retain accorss newer sessions

- To Load vars,clases,config forma  file
	-> jshell -v --startup PRINTING DEFAULT startupsFile.jsh : Loads with class/vars from the file startupsFile.jsh 
		and also create easy methods for printing: This is very useful as we do not have to type System.out.println instead just call pre created method print
- /open jsh file -> import the jsh file once jshell is running, its better than the --startup command while runing jshell -v command
